## About
We needed to make a page design with a navbar, a list of songs, album covers and style the page with CSS. The course instructor allowed us to use frameworks if we wanted, which I did. In this project, I have even functionalized the page, so it works like a music page should. I had some troubles on my way through the project, but there wasn't any problem I couldn't solve. I have learned a lot about frameworks and that it is much faster to create a page with frameworks than without one. Also, I made it possible to play the sounds, change the volume, like and save a track, and change the next sound at the end.
